# Heatshrink glands for SOTABeams traps

I designed these 3D printable glands in OpenSCAD to allow [SOTABeams 
traps](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/hf-antenna-traps-kit-pair/) to be 
easily waterproofed using standard glue-lined heatshrink. SOTABeams 
recommend liquid electrical tape, but I find this a bit messy and using 
heat shrink tubing provides a neater finish as well as giving additional 
protection.

I recommend threading the antenna wire through the gland and the 2 
smaller strain-relief holes on the PCB. The hole in the side of the 
gland can then be used to fill the internal space with adhesive to 
prevent water ingress and secure the grommet to the PCB. The trap can 
then be sealed into 39mm diamater (3:1 shrink) glue lined heatshrink, 
which will seal nicely over the glands.

suitable for many cables including DX-WIRE Ultralight. The .scad file is 
also included, and the parameters are easily tweaked.
